**Abstract**
With the economy starting to recover during the Covid-19 pandemic, economic activity is now running again. The business and trade sectors began to reopen. With the opening of those sectors, it is feared that these activities will be gathered crowds that can accelerate the spread of the Covid-19 virus. This research was conducted to assist the implementation of government regulations regarding the capacity of visitors in closed public spaces seen from the lack of enforcement instruments for these regulations. In this research, a system was built that was able to detect visitors and count the number of visitors using the Yolov4 algorithm. The system will trigger an alarm when the visitor has exceeded the maximum limit specified. The system is also able to warn owners of closed public spaces when visitors exceed the specified capacity through notifications on the owner's device.
